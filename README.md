Hi, team at SigFig!

Navigate into the directory and serve the content however you like. I suggest opening the file in Chrome or running `open http://localhost:8000 && python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` in bash. 


To keep things simple, I used an array of simple objects to generate my gallery. It would take a line or two of code to generate it from provided JSON, but this way the site runs statically.

Primary reference came from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/drag">MDN</a>

Thanks for looking through my work, and I wish you all the best!
